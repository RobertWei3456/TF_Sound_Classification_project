# TF_Sound_Classification_project

### Sound Recongnization Deep Learning Network Based on Tensorflow 2.0
--Robert.wei

The aim of this project is aiming at classify 10 different classes of alarms in complex environment, which contain our product of detecting water leak alarm. however, the challenge is, in everyday life, there's thounsand, maybe millions of sound around us. So this project aimed at developing a artifical intelligence system (aka. deep learing model) which can quickly indentify and classify the alarm type when the specific alarm sound is on.
